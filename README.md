# leafletOpenBusinesses

This is a website displaying updated information on open businesses given a user location in both a map and list form.
The overall website is created primarily with the Flask Python web framework and Jinja html templates. 
Yelp's Fusion API is used to access business data, and the Leaflet Javascript library is used to map data on the front end.
